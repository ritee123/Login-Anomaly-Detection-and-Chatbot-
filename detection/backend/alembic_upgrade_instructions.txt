# IMPORTANT: Database Migration Required

You have changed the User model to include a 'name' field. You must update your database schema.

If you are in development and can reset the database, you can drop the 'users' table and re-run the migration command:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database (e.g., using psql):
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

2. Recreate the table:
   python -c "from db import Base, engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"

If you have existing data you want to keep, use Alembic for migrations.
